				"# Exploring the UniProt protein knowledge base with AWS Open Data and Amazon Neptune\n",
				"\n",
				"## Introduction \n",
				"The [Universal Protein Resource (UniProt)](https://www.uniprot.org/) is a widely used resource of protein data that is now available through the Registry of Open Data on AWS. Its centerpiece is the [UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb), a central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent and rich annotation. UniProt data is highly structured with many relationships between protein sequences, annotations, ontologies and other related data sources. UniProt can be directly accessed via the [UniProt website](https://www.uniprot.org/) and is available for bulk downloads in several formats, including RDF which is particularly well suited to represent the complex and connected nature of the data as a graph. Creating a custom knowledge base can enable more advanced use cases, such as joining with other data sources, augmenting data with custom annotations and relationships, or inferring new relationships with analytics or machine learning.\n",
				"\n",
				"In this example, we will demonstrate the step-by-step process to create and use your own protein knowledge base using UniProt RDF data. We will show how to ingest a subset of UniProtKB data into your own Amazon Neptune database directly from the Registry of Open Data on AWS. We will then show how to query the data with SPARQL, create new relationships in the data and visualize the data as a graph.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Registry of Open Data on AWS\n",
				"The [Registry of Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/) on AWS makes it easy to find datasets made publicly available through AWS services. UniProtKB is made available through the Registry of Open Data via the [Open Data Sponsorship Program](https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/open-data-sponsorship-program/), which covers the cost of storage for publicly available high-value cloud-optimized datasets. UniProtKB is available in the registry as [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) files, a standard model for data interchange on the Web that is capable of capturing complex relationships within the data of the UniProtKB. \n",
				"\n",
				"> **Looking for other data sets or interested in publishing your data?** \n",
				">\n",
				"> [Browse available data](https://registry.opendata.aws/) and learn how to register your own datasets.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Amazon Neptune\n",
				"[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine. This engine is optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Neptune supports the popular graph query languages [Apache TinkerPop Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html) and [W3C’s SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/), enabling you to build queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Creating a custom UniProtKB\n",
				"In this example, we select a list of UniProt RDF files that we are interested in exploring. Then we ingest the RDF files from the Open Data Registry on AWS into Amazon Neptune DB. Once the data is ingested, we demonstrate how to query relationships and attributes. By adapting this example to your own research needs, you should be able to build a subset of UniProtKB containing data for your specific use case. This example will also be the foundation of our follow-on example where we will use [Neptune ML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html) to predict relationships and attributes in the UniProtKB."

				"## Brief overview of UniProt data\n",
				"UniProt RDF files are located in a public S3 bucket `s3://aws-open-data-uniprot-rdf`. There are different paths for each data release. New data releases typically happen every two months, so be sure to use the latest release directory. We use the first release of 2021, which has a path of `s3://aws-open-data-uniprot-rdf/2021-01`. For more information on the data, go to the [UniProt help pages](https://www.uniprot.org/help/). Here is a brief description for some of the different datasets and files.\n",
				"\n",
				"#### Taxonomy, Gene Ontology (GO) and other reference data\n",
				"UniProt uses several supporting reference datasets that contain related information and metadata. Among these are the [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy), for the hierarchical classification of organisms, and the [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/docs/introduction-to-go-resource/), used to describe the current scientific knowledge about the functions of proteins. The GO is represented with the [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%5FOntology%5FLanguage), which is used to define ontologies that describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of a knowledge graph. OWL is also built upon RDF.\n",

				"#### UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)\n",
				"The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent and rich annotation. In addition to capturing the core data mandatory for each UniProtKB entry (mainly, the amino acid sequence, protein name, taxonomic data and citation information), as much additional annotation as possible is added. This includes widely accepted biological ontologies, classifications and cross-references, and clear indications of the quality of annotation in the form of evidence attribution of experimental and computational data. The UniProtKB dataset is split into files based on the top levels of the [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) (the file name indicates the classification and ID of the taxon) that contain at most 1 million protein entries. Obsolete entries are provided in separate files with at most 10 million entries (uniprotkb_obsolete_\\*.rdf). For more information on the knowledgebase, see the [UniProtKB documentation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb).\n",
				"\n",
				"#### UniProt Sequence archive (UniParc)\n",
				"The UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the publicly available protein sequences in the world. Data is partitioned into files of around 1 Gigabyte in size depending on the size of the protein sequence. For more information on this archive, see the [UniParc documentation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc).\n",
				"\n",
				"#### UniProt Reference clusters (UniRef)\n",
				"The UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProtKB and selected UniParc records in order to obtain complete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Unlike in UniParc, sequence fragments are merged in UniRef. The UniRef dataset is split into files that contain about 100,000 clusters each. For more information on reference clusters, see the [UniRef documentation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref).\n",
				"\n",
				"#### What does the data look like?\n",
				"An RDF file is a document written in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) language, that was created to represent relationships between web resources. It’s also used to create ontologies for different domains. RDF contains information about an entity as structured metadata. RDF graphs contain statements with a subject, predicate and object, also known as a triple. The subject is the main actor, the predicate is the action or verb, and the object is what is acted upon. A triple can be used to associate a subject with a property or define a relationship between two subjects.\n",
				"\n",
				"As an illustration, let’s look at how the taxonomy is represented in RDF. In the RDF listing, we see that [taxonomy 9606](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9606) is defined as Homo Sapiens. Taxonomy 9606 is a subclass of [taxonomy 9605](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9605), defined as Homininae. The subject is *taxonomy 9606*, the predicate is *subclass* and the object is *taxonomy 9605*. In addition, taxonomy 9606 has a narrower transitive relationship to [taxonomy 63221](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/63221), defined as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, as well as [taxonomy 741158](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/741158), defined as Homo sapiens subsp. 'Denisova'. Expressed in RDF terms, the subject is *taxonomy 9606*, the predicate is *narrower transitive relationship* and the objects are *taxonomy 63221* and *taxonomy 741158*.\n",

				"\n",
				"### Accessing the data\n",
				"Before we can load data into the Neptune instance, we need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has access to the public bucket where the UniProt data resides. In addition, the Neptune loader requires a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. For more information on bulk loading requirements, refer to the [Neptune documentation on bulk loading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html). The IAM role and VPC endpoint have already been configured by our cloud formation template. We just need to define the role and endpoint settings."

If you would like to explore further, you can easily run this yourself in your own account. Some other things to try would be joining to other graph databases using federated queries, querying features to train machine learning models, or inferring links with Neptune ML.\n"
